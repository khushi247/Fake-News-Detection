# Fake News Detector
## Overview
The Fake News Detector is an AI-powered system designed to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" based on their titles and content. Utilizing deep learning techniques, this tool provides real-time feedback on the credibility of news articles, making it a valuable resource for media verification, fact-checking, and ensuring the trustworthiness of information in the digital space.

## Features
### Real-Time Detection: 
Users can input a news title and its content to instantly check if it is real or fake.
### Advanced DL Model: 
The project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network trained on a dataset of labeled news articles.
### User-Friendly Interface: 
A Gradio interface is provided for easy interaction with the model.
### Text Preprocessing:
The system preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and lemmatizing before feeding it into the model.
## System Architecture
### Frontend: 
The user interface is built using Gradio, allowing easy input and real-time output.
#### Backend:
Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned using NLTK to remove noise and standardize input.
Model: An LSTM neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras is used for prediction.
Data: The model is trained on a large dataset containing real and fake news articles.

## Core Components
1. Frontend Design
Gradio Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the model.
2. Backend Functionality
Text Preprocessing: Uses NLTK for tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
